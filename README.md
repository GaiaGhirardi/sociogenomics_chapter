# Chapter in Handbook of Quantitative Methods in Sociology
## Integrating molecular genetics methods to social stratification research

Gaia Ghirardi, Selin KÃ¶ksal, Fabrizio Bernardi, Nicola Barban

This chapter aims to equip sociologists with fundamental knowledge to integrate genetics data into their research. Here, we provide an example of GxE analysis by applying some of the concepts discussed in this chapter. In this application, we ask: Do genes matter more for educational attainment among high or low-SES individuals? This is the same as asking whether the PGI for educational attainment is more predictive of educational attainment among low or high-SES individuals. We address this question using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).
